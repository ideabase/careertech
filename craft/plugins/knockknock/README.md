# KnockKnock plugin for Craft CMS

Password protect your entire craft website with a single password. A fast and easy way to lock down access to your website, without worrying about Apache or Nginx configuration.

## Installation

To install KnockKnock, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `knockknock` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/dgrigg/knockknock.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
4. The plugin folder should be named `knockknock` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

KnockKnock works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## KnockKnock Overview
Any one who visits your website will be asked for a password before they can see your website. Perfect for locking down websites in development that are on a public domain.

## Configuring KnockKnock
